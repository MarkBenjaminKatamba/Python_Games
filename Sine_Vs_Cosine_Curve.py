# For this project, you will have to generate a sine vs cosine curve. 
# You will need to use the numpy library to access the sine and cosine functions. 
# You will also need to use the matplotlib library to draw the curve. 
# To make this more difficult, make the graph go from -360° to 360°, with there being a 180° 
# difference between each point on the x-axis.
