'''
This is probably the hardest one out of these 6 small projects. 
This will be similar to guessing the number, except we are guessing the word. 
The user needs to guess letters, Give the user no more than 6 attempts for 
guessing wrong letter. This will mean you will have to have a counter. 
You can download a ‘sowpods’ dictionary file or csv file to use as a way to 
get a random word to use.
